            <p>
                Taskly is an opinionated Agile project management (PM)
                application. It offers a simplified featureset and experience,
                to compete against the dominant PM solutions in the market. My
                capstone team and I built the project over our senior year, and
                worked together to overcome a multitude of challenges to deliver
                on our team goals and requirements.

                    <p className="paragraph">
                        When first brainstorming the direction we wanted to take
                        Taskly we identified that many of the dominant PM tools
                        in the software industry were plagued with complexity
                        and feature bloat. We identified that this complexity
                        was leading to inefficiencies and steep learning curves
                        which were both contributing to cost and time wasted for
                        the businesses that were using them. We believed that
                        this problem was something we could provide a solution
                        to.
                    </p>
                    <p className="paragraph">
                        Taskly was born as a strait forward, opinionated,
                        approach to Agile PM that would reduce company
                        onboarding time, free up developer resources, and
                        improve project success. The final product delivers on
                        our ideas.

                        Our hope was that small businesses would see the value
                        in a simplified tool, especially because they have less
                        margin for error. Despite never gaining traction the
                        project was a successful learning experience for the
                        whole team, and has future potential with the right
                        direction.

                                In this phase the team met, researched the realm
                                of project management, identified a goal, and
                                constructed a loose plan of action including
                                choosing our technology, system design,
                                communication guidelines, project

                                project, where we took the planned we had done
                                and created sprints with overarching goals and
                                delegated objectives. The entire team really
                                pushed this term to move the project forward and
                                accomplish our goals. By the end of the term we
                                had an MVP, something which worked and had a
                                subset of the primary features we had planned to
                                integrate but we the project was still
                                incomplete and unrefined.
