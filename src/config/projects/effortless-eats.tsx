                        Effortless Eats aims to provide users with an
                        easy-to-navigate platform for ordering food, featuring a
                        series of well-thought-out pages to streamline the
                        ordering process. The project was developed as part of
                        an Intro to Usability Engineering course, incorporating
                        extensive user feedback and heuristic evaluations to
                        refine the design.

                        This project involved creating high-fidelity prototypes
                        and conducting usability testing to gather feedback and
                        improve the design. The design process was iterative,
                        with multiple rounds of testing and refinement to ensure
                        the final product met user needs and expectations.
